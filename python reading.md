# Things I Know and Don’t Know

## Things I Know:

Chapter 1: Python can be run directly in a browser, which makes it easy to get started without needing to install anything initially.

Chapter 2: Functions are reusable blocks of code in programming that can be called to perform specific tasks. This is a concept that is common across many programming languages.

Chapter 5: Infinite recursion happens when a function keeps calling itself forever, leading to a crash of the program.

Chapter 10: I understand that lists and strings are sequence types in Python.

## Things I Don’t Know:

Chapter 1: When writing large numbers in Python, you should avoid using commas like 1,000,000 as this would be interpreted as a list of separate numbers. Instead, it’s better to use underscores for clarity, like 1_000_000.

Chapter 2: When you define a function in Python, it doesn’t run the code inside it immediately. It just creates a function object. The code inside the function will only execute when the function is called. Therefore, if you define a function but never call it, nothing from its body will be executed.

Chapter 5: The Koch Curve is a famous shape in mathematics that is a type of fractal. A fractal is a pattern that repeats itself in smaller and smaller versions, similar to how recursion works.

Chapter 10: Lists in Python are mutable, meaning you can change their contents, like modifying the elements inside them. Strings, on the other hand, are immutable, meaning you cannot change a single character of a string once it is created, unlike the elements of a list.
