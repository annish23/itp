# Emo Band Project 🎸🖤

Check it out live 👉 [Band Website](https://zcfischthal.github.io/)

This project showcases our emo band concept, including a band logo, band bio, member bios, group photo, and audio functionality. It was created as part of our class assignment using Professor Rachel's starter code.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 Custom CSS with a black background and white text to match the emo theme  
- 🖼️ Band logo added at the top for branding  
- 📖 Band bio included to tell the story and vibe of the group  
- 📸 Group photo of the band members  
- 👤 Individual member bios with images, centered on the page  
- 🎵 Working audio controls (turns out the `.wav` file name was case-sensitive!)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML  
- CSS  
- Starter code by Professor Rachel

## 🔍 Research & Problem Solving

- Googled how to change the background color and text color using CSS (e.g., `background-color: black; color: white;`) to fit the emo aesthetic.
- Used online resources and forums to troubleshoot layout and styling issues.
- Researched how to embed and troubleshoot audio playback in HTML.

## 🧪 Challenges & Fixes

- **Audio playback** – Initially not working due to incorrect capitalization in the `.wav` file name. Once fixed, it worked as intended.
- **Styling** – Centering images, aligning text, and applying the emo theme through custom CSS.
- **Media organization** – Added and arranged the band logo, group photo, and bios in a visually cohesive layout.

Steps we took:
- Chose a visual theme and emo vibe

## 🧍‍♀️ Self-Assessment

As a group member, I played a key role in driving the creative direction of the Emo Band Project. I coordinated with teammates to gather bios and visuals, and made sure each person had a distinct persona. I also used ChatGPT to help brainstorm and refine our band narrative and bios to stay on-theme.

Throughout the process, I kept team morale up, encouraged collaboration, and made sure everyone’s contributions were included. I didn’t do as much of the coding, but I was highly involved in vision, planning, and content.
