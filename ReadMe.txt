I know I need to use else-if for multiple conditions because there are several conditions in the assignment. 
I then use a for loop to set up the prompt. I used if, else if, and else statements to set up the conditions. Since there are four conditions, I used else if twice. I was surprised that it worked. 
Afterward, I used console.log to display the results from each statement.
